# EWM - Emacs Wayland Manager

![EWM Screenshot](docs/ewm-showcase.png)

EWM is a Wayland compositor that runs inside Emacs as a dynamic module. Wayland applications appear as Emacs buffers — switch between apps with `C-x b`, manage windows with familiar Emacs commands, and keep everything responsive even when Emacs is evaluating. Built with Rust and [Smithay](https://github.com/Smithay/smithay), inspired by [EXWM](https://github.com/ch11ng/exwm) and [niri](https://github.com/YaLTeR/niri).
